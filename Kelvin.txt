The problem with the code is the first part of the formula is 5/9 each java will print as 0 even though the answer would be 0.56. 
This is because is was not specified to Java for it to be printed as a double. To fix this, you could convert the fraction 5/9 to
its decimal form and this would run fine and produce the right output.
